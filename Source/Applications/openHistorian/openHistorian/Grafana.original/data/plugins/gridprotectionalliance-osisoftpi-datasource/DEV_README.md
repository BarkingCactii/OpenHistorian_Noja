# Developer Notes

[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
are needed to compile this project.

Before committing source code changes to the repository,
be sure to run the main `grunt` task from the command line
to update the `dist` folder. This will also update the distribution
readme file.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can launch the terminal
using `ctrl+~` and issue the `grunt` command directly from the editor.
